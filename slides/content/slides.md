# Get Started

### Node.js (or io... whatevs)

1. Best on Mac/Linux is [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Winders has it's own [exe](https://nodejs.org/)...
1. [IO.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) is also an option (for now)

# Get WebPack

```shell
npm install -g webpack
```

* `-g` installs globally
